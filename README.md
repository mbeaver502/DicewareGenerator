# DicewareGenerator
"Randomly" generates passphrases based on the Diceware system.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------

# Description

This software is meant to be used to "randomly" generate passphrases based on the
Diceware system. This software was created in response to the following article:
https://firstlook.org/theintercept/2015/03/26/passphrases-can-memorize-attackers-cant-guess/.
Anyone may use and edit this software as permitted by the license below. This 
initial version is not particularly extensible due to much of the "variable" parts
being hardcoded (e.g., how many dice to roll). This will (likely) change with
future versions. Comments are sparse and functional decomposition is nonexistent.
Also, the wordlist file must be in the same directory as the executable. What you 
see is what you get.

# Change Log:

          NB: The initial version was written in about 2 hours as proof of concept.
